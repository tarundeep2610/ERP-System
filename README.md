# ERP System

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, designed to manage basic business operations efficiently. The system consists of the following pages:

- **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of the system's features.
- **Products Management**: Allows for the management of product listings.
- **Orders Management**: Facilitates viewing and handling orders.

Additionally, an optional feature has been implemented:

- **Orders Calendar View**: A calendar interface displaying orders based on their expected delivery dates.

## Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly interface for managing key aspects of a business.
- Utilize React for building modular components and managing application state.
- Implement navigation between different sections of the ERP system using React Router.
- Create a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Assignment Details

### Dashboard:

- Display a summary of key metrics or features (e.g., total number of products, orders).
- Include links or buttons for quick navigation to the Products and Orders management pages.

### Products Management:

- Present a list of products with details such as name, category, price, and stock quantity, using mock data.
